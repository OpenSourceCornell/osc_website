Join us for our weekly meeting! This time, former club
president
[Patrick Niedzielski (broken link)][patrick]{:class="h-card"} will be
discussing generic programming with iterators[^1], based on his CppCon
2016 talk, [*From Zero to Iterators* (broken link)][iterators]
([slides][iterators-slides], [YouTube][iterators-youtube]). This
presentation will be aimed at technical audiences, but won't require
extensive C++ knowledge.

[^1]: these aren't your Java iterators[^2].
[^2]: you probably shouldn't compare them to Java iterators, for that matter.
