Pining for summer after the snowfall this weekend? Why not come
discuss summer plans with OpenSourceCornell? This week, we'll be
talking about how you can get involved with open source projects over
the summer, including

  * [Google Summer of Code][gsoc],
  * [Rails Girls Summer of Code][rgsoc],
  * and companies based around open source (such as [Mozilla][mozilla] and [Red Hat][redhat]).
