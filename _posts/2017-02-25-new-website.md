OpenSourceCornell finally has its own website! From now on, we'll be
posting events on here as well as [Facebook][facebook] and our mailing
list. Also, be sure to check back for updates on club projects and
what's going on in free and open-source software.

This site supports the IndieWeb, as discussed at a
recent [weekly meeting][indiewebevent]. WebMention support is still
forthcoming, but posts are marked up with [h-entry][h-entry], events
have [h-event][h-event], and the site itself has an [h-card][h-card].

If you're interested, the source code can be found
at [Github][repo]. Feel free to file any issues you encounter, or even
fix them if you want!

### Future Plans

With our website live, we can turn our attention to other uses of the
website and the club server hosting it. We'd like to set up things
from [generating calendar events][repo-ical-issue] (so you can be free
of Facebook for event notifications) to running a [Matrix.org][matrix]
chat server.
