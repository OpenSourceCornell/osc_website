Want to get more involved in open source over the summer? There's two
programs that you might be interested in
then: [Google Summer of Code][gsoc]
and [Rails Girls Summer of Code][rgsoc]. Both programs sponsor
students to spend their summers working on open-source projects
alongside mentors, helping you learn more about contributing to
projects. And both are accepting applications right now!

There's a short blurb about both programs on
the [unofficial CS wiki][wiki-opportunities], alongside more
information about general summer positions.

### Google Summer of Code

**Application Period:** March 20, 2017–April 3, 2017

Probably the better-known program, Google Summer of Code lets you
spend 3 months working on a project that you propose alongside mentors
from a participating organization. So you'll go into the summer
knowing who exactly you'll be working with and what exactly you'll be
doing. Some of the participating organizations this year include:
  * [SymPy][gsoc-sympy], a Python computer algebra system (much like
    Wolfram Mathematica),
  * [Mozilla][gsoc-mozilla], a web company that makes the Firefox
    browser, Rust programming language, and more,
  * and [The Internet Archive][gsoc-archive], a non-profit working on
    preserving the Internet and building a library of its content.
You can find the [full list here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/).

### Rails Girls Summer of Code

**Application Period:** February 1, 2017–March 8, 2017

Rails Girls Summer of Code is similar to Google Summer of Code, but
aims at newcomers and at bringing more diversity into
open-source. Their goal is to help you learn valuable skills while
getting oriented in the world of open-source projects. You'll still
have a mentor and a project you propose, but you apply with a
teammate, so you won't be going alone. Contrary to the name, this
program isn't only about Ruby on Rails: some participating projects
this year are
  * [if-me][rgsoc-if-me], a non-profit mental health communication app
    that encourages talking with loved ones,
  * [Servo][rgsoc-servo], a Mozilla project working on a
    next-generation browser engine,
  * and the [Wikimedia Foundation][rgsoc-wikimedia], the non-profit
    behind Wikipedia.
The [full list](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects) has
even more.

If you're not sure about what to do, find a project you like and reach
out! These organizations have lots of project ideas will work with you
on your proposal—you're helping them as much as they're helping you.

Keep an eye out for a future meeting discussing these programs and more!
